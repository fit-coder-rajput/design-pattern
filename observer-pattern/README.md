The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects. 
In this pattern, an object, called the Subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called Observers, 
and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is widely used in 
scenarios where the state of one object must be reflected across many others.

Key Components:

Subject: The object that holds the state and sends notifications when the state changes. It maintains a list of observers.

Observer: The objects that need to be informed about changes in the subject.

ConcreteSubject: A specific implementation of the subject. It stores the state of interest to the observers and notifies them when the state changes.

ConcreteObserver: A specific implementation of an observer. It updates its state based on the notifications from the subject.
